Promo spend has 4492 missing values which means that these customers did not use any kind of Promo and only booked by paying full amount. For these values we can impute using 0 as that would specify the amount they spent using promo was 0. But before that i would like to create a new categorical feature which would show if a customer used promo or not (but this feature will not be used for our K means Clustering as it might create some issues). Similar for Missing values in Paidspend, which has missing values only when the customer has used promo entirely. so we can impute using 0 here aswell.. Any values that imply 0 in the Paid spend/hour means either that the person used promo only to book his rides, or that the person has not driven his rides for an entire hour, which is why hours booked is 0 in these cases, that means that the person has booked only for short periods of times\n"
