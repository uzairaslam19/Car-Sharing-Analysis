    "By making sure there is some kind of incentive for uploading the correct document carefully and in a clear way, the chance of human error can be reduced on the customers end, instead of focusing just on hurrying through the process and getting into a car, the customer will also focus on getting the points for proper authentication \n",
    "\n",
    "- **On developer end check and test the approval procedure to see if it randomly rejects correctly uploaded documents**, in some scenerios such as Grab Wallet, even though you upload proper documents in a proper manner, the system sometimes does not authenticate and no proper reasoning is given for rejection, this frustrates the customer and results in customer loosing interest in the product\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If authentication process includes document evaluation being done by employees, then it is essential to make sure they are trained in a proper manner and taught to be unbiased in all regards** If an employee is biased towards certain group of people, or is in a mood that might effect his/her sentiment towards the cutomers, it may effect his judgment. This may result in loss of potential customers or wastage of time for gaining a potential sale or reservation in time "
